## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Materialze

This app was based on a tutorial by Brad Traversy. You can find his code <a href="">here</a> a the video <a href="">here</a>.
I went through this tutiorial with a Twitch streamer known as Mayanwolfe. You can find here tutorial here</a>.

## What I Would Change If I Had More Time

There are a few issues that need to be resolved and a few features I would like to add:
<ul>
<li>Text wrapping for longer Google profile names.</li>
<li>Making sure the public stories box sizes stay the same size.</li>
<li>Additional login options besides google would be nice.</li>
<li>Image storage and the ability to add images.</li>
<li>The ability to update your profile with additional information and to change the profile photo.</li>
</ul>


## Lessons Learned:

While building this app I learned a lot about MVC architecture structure. This was also my first time using Handlebars and Materialze.
